    <p id="about-me">Hi! My name is Ranya El-Shinawy and I am a bridge student
      at UT Austin. I am currently getting a Master's degree in Information Technology
      and Management, while getting a Bachelor's degree in journalism.
      I am passionate about learning more about AI and machine learning and how we can use
      these technologies responsibly. In my free time, I enjoy reading,
      baking, and learning about space.
